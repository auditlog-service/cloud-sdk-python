Feature: Destination Service Integration
  As a developer using the SDK
  I want to manage destinations
  So that I can configure external system connections

  Background:
    Given the destination service is available
    And I have valid destination clients

  Scenario: Create and read instance-level destination
    Given I have a destination named "test-dest-instance" of type "HTTP"
    And the destination has URL "https://api.example.com"
    And the destination has proxy type "Internet"
    And the destination has authentication "NoAuthentication"
    When I create the destination at instance level
    Then the destination creation should be successful
    When I get instance destination "test-dest-instance"
    Then the destination should be retrieved successfully
    And the destination URL should be "https://api.example.com"
    And I clean up the instance destination "test-dest-instance"

  Scenario: Create and read subaccount-level destination with provider access
    Given I have a destination named "test-dest-subaccount" of type "HTTP"
    And the destination has URL "https://provider-api.example.com"

    Then the destination creation should be successful
    When I update the destination URL to "https://updated.example.com"
    And I update the destination at subaccount level
    Then the destination update should be successful
    When I get subaccount destination "test-dest-update" with "PROVIDER_ONLY" access strategy
    Then the destination URL should be "https://updated.example.com"
